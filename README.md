# Mitral-Valve-Echocardiography
Four types of mitral valve morphology videos dataset based on the Carpentier classification scheme
The selection was done in keeping with Carpentierâ€™s functional classification Type II, Type IIIa, Type IIIb, and normal. In other words, the data selected were on MVP, rheumatic MS, MV leaflets with restricted motions due to regional wall motion abnormalities or LV dilation, and MV leaflets with normal motions. In Type IIIa pathological morphologies such as rheumatic MS, patients with prosthetic MVs were excluded. Images of patients with more than 1 pathology and the resultant change in the MV morphology were also excluded. Our network was not trained regarding mixed pathologies (morphologies) of the MV.
The A4C and PLA movies of each patient were extracted in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Each movie was labeled by a highly experienced echocardiologist as normal, MVP, Rheumatic MS, and mitral restricted motion valve due to supporting MV apparatus pathologies such as left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities or ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (type IIIb). In total, 1773 cases with A4C and PLA views were gathered, including 424 cases with normal MVs, 155 Type II cases (MVP), 392 Type IIIa cases (rheumatic MS), and 802 Type IIIb (mitral restricted motion) cases
